### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Find and use external api to render population data.
- Apply an input field/form for user input that returns specific data based on zip code (key) input.  

#### PostMVP 

- Add additional styling and CSS properties.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Input Field/Form | H | 5hrs| 6hrs | 6hrs |
| Establish API Relationship | H | 1hrs| 1hrs | 1hrs |
| Working with API | H | 5hrs| 3hrs | 3hrs |
| HTML/CSS/JS | H | 10hrs| 10hrs | 10hrs |
| Functionality/Responsive | H | 5hrs| 6hrs | 6hrs |
| Finishing touches Styling/Layout | M | 5hrs| 3hrs | 3hrs |
| Total | H | 31hrs| 29hrs | 29hrs |

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

<!-- let data = document.querySelector("#data-row");
    data.innerHTML = results.data[0].percent_female + '</br>' + results.data[0].percent_male + '</br>' + results.data[0].percent_gender_total;
    console.log(data) -->

## Change Log
Based on the specifics of the API information, I changed the objectve of my website from neighborhood information to zip code information.
